# Database

This directory should contain all scripts to interact with the database.

Idealy it contains a "crud" file per model

> What does "crud" mean?
> CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, and Delete**, which are the four basic operations used in most applications that work with data. Create means adding new data (like signing up for an account), Read is retrieving or viewing data (like checking your profile), Update is modifying existing data (like changing your password), and Delete removes data (like deleting a post). These operations are essential for managing information in databases, websites, and apps.
